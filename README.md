# Challenge-4-Soccer-Scripting
 This is the fourth challenge in the course - Create with Code, Unit 4 - Gameplay Mechanics in Unity Projects where I used the skills I learned in the Sumo Battle prototype in a completely different context: the soccer field. Just like in the prototype, I have to control a ball by rotating the camera around it and applying a forward force, but instead of knocking them off the edge, my goal is to knock them into the opposing net while they try to get into my net. Just like in the Sumo Battle, after every round a new wave will spawn with more enemy balls, putting my defense to the test. However, almost nothing in this project is functioning! Itâ€™s my job to get it working correctly.
